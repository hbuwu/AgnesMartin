	<h1>Agnes Martin</h1>

	<div class="colored1">
		<h2>Profile</h2>
		<p>Agnes Bernice Martin (March 22, 1912 – December 16, 2004) was a Canadian-born American
			abstract
			painter. Her work
			has been defined as an "essay in discretion on inward-ness and silence". Although she is often considered or
			referred to as a minimalist, Martin considered herself an abstract expressionist. She was awarded a
			National Medal of Arts from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1998.</p>
	</div>


	<div class="colored2">
		<h2>Personal Life</h2>
		<p>Agnes Bernice Martin was born in 1912 to Scottish Presbyterian farmers in Macklin, Saskatchewan, one of four
			children. From 1919, she grew up in Vancouver. She moved to the United States in 1931 to
			help her pregnant sister, Mirabell, in Bellingham, Washington. She preferred American higher
			education and became an American citizen in 1950. Martin studied at Western Washington University College
			of Education, Bellingham, Washington, prior to receiving her B.A. (1942) from Teachers College, Columbia
			University. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="colored1">
		<h2>Personal Life</h2>
		<p>In 1947 she attended the Summer Field School of the University of New Mexico in Taos, New
			Mexico. After hearing lectures by the Zen Buddhist scholar D. T. Suzuki at Columbia, she became
			interested in Asian thought, not as a religious discipline, but as a code of ethics, a practical how-to for
			getting through life. A few years following graduation, Martin matriculated at the University of New
			Mexico, Albuquerque, where she also taught art courses before returning to Columbia University to earn her
			M.A. (1952). </p>
	</div>

	<div class="colored2">
		<h2>Personal Life</h2>
		<p>She moved to New York City in 1957 and lived in a loft in Coenties Slip in lower
			Manhattan. She left New York City in 1967, disappearing from the art world to live alone. After
			eighteen months on the road, Martin settled in Cuba, New Mexico (1968-1977), and then Galisteo, New Mexico
			(1977-1993). She built an adobe home for herself in each location. She lived alone all her adult
			life. In 1993 she moved to a retirement residence in Taos, New Mexico, where she lived until her death in
			2004.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="colored1">
		<h2>Career</h2>
		<p>Her work is most closely associated with Taos, with some of her early work visibly inspired by the desert
			environment of New Mexico. She moved to New York City at the invitation of the artist/gallery owner Betty
			Parsons in 1957 (the women had met prior to 1954). That year, she settled in Coenties Slip in lower
			Manhattan, where her friends and neighbors, several of whom were also affiliated with Parsons, included
			Robert Indiana, Ellsworth Kelly, Jack Youngerman, and Lenore Tawney. Barnett Newman actively promoted
			Martin's work, and helped install Martin's exhibitions at Betty Parsons Gallery beginning in the late
			1950s.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="colored2">
		<h2>Career</h2>
		<p>In 1961 Martin contributed a brief introduction to a brochure for her friend Lenore Tawney's first solo
			exhibition, the only occasion on which she wrote on the work of a fellow artist. In 1967, Martin
			famously abandoned her life in New York. Cited reasons include the death of her friend Ad Reinhardt the
			demolition of many buildings on Coenties Slip, and a breakup with the artist Chryssa whom Martin had dated
			off and on throughout the 1960s.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="colored1">
		<h2>Career</h2>
		<p>In her ten years living in New York Martin was frequently hospitalized to control symptoms of schizophrenia
			which manifested in the artist in a number of ways, including aural hallucinations and states of catatonia:
			on a number of occasions she received electroconvulsive therapy at Manhattan's Bellevue Hospital. After
			Martin left New York, she drove about the western US and Canada, deciding to settle in Cuba, New Mexico for
			a few years (1968-1977), then settled in Galisteo, New Mexico (1977-1993). In both New Mexico
			homes, she built adobe brick structures herself.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="colored2">
		<h2>Career</h2>
		<p>She did not return to art until 1973 and consciously distanced herself from the social life and social events
			that brought other artists into the public eye.[12] She collaborated with architect Bill Katz in 1974 on a
			log cabin she would use as her studio. That same year, she completed a group of new paintings and from
			1975 they were exhibited regularly. In 1976 she made her first film, Gabriel, a 78-minute landscape film
			which features a little boy going for a
			walk. A second movie, Captivity, was never completed after the artist threw the rough cut into the town
			dump.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="colored1">
		<h2>Career</h2>
		<p>According to a filmed interview with her that was released in 2003, she had moved from New York City only
			when she was told her rented loft/workspace/studio would be no longer available because of the building's
			imminent demolition. She went on further to state that she could not conceive of working in any other space
			in New York. When she died at age 92, she was said not to have read a newspaper for the last 50 years.
			Essays in the book dedicated to the exhibition of her work in New York at The Drawing Center (traveling to
			other museums as well) in 2005 – 3x abstraction – analyzed the spiritual dimension in Martin's work.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="colored2">
		<h2>Artistic Styles</h2>
		<p>In addition to a couple of self-portraits and a few watercolor landscapes, Martin's early works included
			biomorphic paintings in subdued colors made when the artist had a grant to work in Taos between 1955 and
			1957. However, she did her best to seek out and destroy paintings from the years when she was taking her
			first steps into abstraction.Martin praised Mark Rothko for having "reached zero so that nothing could stand
			in the way of truth". Following his example Martin also pared down to the most reductive elements to
			encourage a perception of perfection and to emphasize transcendent reality.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="colored1">
		<h2>Artistic Styles</h2>
		<p>Her signature style was defined by an emphasis upon
			line, grids, and fields of extremely subtle color. Particularly in her breakthrough years of the early
			1960s, she created 6 × 6 foot square canvases that were covered in dense, minute and softly delineated
			graphite grids.In the 1966 exhibition Systemic Painting at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Martin's grids
			were therefore celebrated as examples of Minimalist art and were hung among works by artists including Sol
			LeWitt, Robert Ryman, and Donald Judd. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="colored2">
		<h2>Artistic Styles</h2>
		<p>While minimalist in form, however, these paintings were quite different in
			spirit from those of her other minimalist counterparts, retaining small flaws and unmistakable traces of the
			artist's hand; she shied away from intellectualism, favoring the personal and spiritual. Her paintings,
			statements, and influential writings often reflected an interest in Eastern philosophy, especially Taoist.
			Because of her work's added spiritual dimension, which became more and more dominant after 1967, she
			preferred to be classified as an abstract expressionist.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="colored1">
		<h2>Exhibitions</h2>
		<p>Since her first solo exhibition in 1958, Martin's work has been the subject of more than 85 solo shows and
			two retrospectives including the survey, Agnes Martin, organized by the Whitney Museum of American Art, New
			York, which later traveled to Jamaica (1992–94) and Agnes Martin: Paintings and Drawings 1974–1990 organized
			by the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, with subsequent venues in France and Germany (1991–92). In 1998, The
			Museum of Fine Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico mounted Agnes Martin Works on Paper. In 2002, the Menil
			Collection, Houston, mounted Agnes Martin: The Nineties and Beyond. That same year, the Harwood Museum of
			Art at the University of New Mexico, Pandora, organized Agnes Martin: Paintings from 2001, as well as a
			symposium honoring Martin on the occasion of her 90th birthday.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="colored2">
		<h2>Exhibitions</h2>
		<p>In addition to participating in an international array of group exhibitions such as the Venice Biennale
			(1997, 1980, 1976), the Whitney Biennial (1995, 1977), and Documenta, Kassel, Germany (1972), Martin has
			been the recipient of multiple honors including the Lifetime Achievement Award on behalf of the Women's
			Caucus for Art of the College Art Association (2005); Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences
			(1992); the Governor's Award for Excellence and Achievement in the Arts given by Governor Gary Johnson,
			Santa Fe, New Mexico (1998); the National Medal of Arts awarded by President Bill Clinton and the
			National Endowment for the Arts (1998); the Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement by the
			College Art Association (1998); the Golden Lion for Contribution to Contemporary Art at the Venice Biennale
			(1997);</p>
	</div>

	<div class="colored1">
		<h2>Exhibitions</h2>
		<p>Exhibitions continue to be mounted since her death in 2004, including Agnes Martin: Closing the Circle, Early
			and Late Feb 10, 2006 – Mar 04, 2006 at Pace Gallery. Other exhibitions have been held in New York,
			Zurich, London, Dublin, Edinburgh, Cambridge (England), Aspen, Albuquerque, New Mexico and in Penticton,
			British Columbia in Canada. In 2015, Tate Modern ran a retrospective of her life and career from the
			1950s until her last work in 2004, which will travel to other museums after the show in London.
			At the University of Michigan Museum of Art, Martin was featured in the exhibition Reductive Minimalism:
			Women Artists in Dialogue, 1960-2014 which examined the two generations of Minimalist art side-by-side, from
			October 2014 through January 2015. The exhibition included Anne Truitt, Mary Corse, and contemporary artists
			Shirazeh Houshiary and Tomma Abts.</p>
